# NDA-CW-1

This is a non-exhaustive review of network data analysis techniques for analysis of the PROPERTIES.csv file, a data set which represents the social networks of editors that voluntarily contribute to Wikidata Talk pages. These are pages in which editors can discuss a variety of Wikidata subjects – in this case, specific properties. Each page has a specific name and within each page there are threads. Once in the thread, editors can add their comments. They are also able to open any new thread they believe is relevant within the page. Each comment is labelled with the editors unique username, this enables the tracking of who said what and when. The data has been given in the following form (table 1). This report will more specifically cover the construction of a network from this data, exploration of the basic network metrics, analysing how we can apply epidemic models. Finally we will analyse the “quality” of the built network.
